function t = isrowvector(x)
%ISROWVECTOR True for row vector input.
%
%   ISROWVECTOR(X) returns 1 if X is a row vector and 0 otherwise.
%
%   An array is considered a row vector if the length along each dimension,
%   except possibly the second, is never larger than one.  That is,
%   SIZE(X, DIM) <= 1 for all DIM except possibly when DIM = 2.
