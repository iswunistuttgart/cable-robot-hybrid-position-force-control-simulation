%XKRON Kronecker tensor product.
%
%    XKRON(X,Y), where X and Y are matrices, is the Kronecker tensor product
%    of X and Y.  The result is a large matrix formed by taking all possible
%    products between the elements of X and those of Y.
%
%    For example, if X is 2-by-3, and Y is any N-dimensional array, then
%    KRON(X,Y) is
%
%      [ X(1,1)*Y  X(1,2)*Y  X(1,3)*Y
%         X(2,1)*Y  X(2,2)*Y  X(2,3)*Y ]
%
%    If either X or Y is sparse, and neither X nor Y has dimension
%    greater than 2, then only nonzero elements are multiplied in the
%    computation, and the result is sparse.
%
%    XKRON works also when X and/or Y are N-dimensional arrays.  There does
%    not seem to be a unique definition of an N-dimensional Kronecker tensor
%    product, so I simply picked the one I found most logical.
%
%    If X is 3-by-4-by-2, and Y is any N-dimensional array, then
%
%      cat( 3, [ X(1,1,1)*Y  X(1,2,1)*Y  X(1,3,1)*Y  X(1,4,1)*Y ;  ...
%                    X(2,1,1)*Y  X(2,2,1)*Y  X(2,3,1)*Y  X(2,4,1)*Y ;  ...
%                    X(3,1,1)*Y  X(3,2,1)*Y  X(3,3,1)*Y  X(3,4,1)*Y ], ...
%                 [ X(1,1,2)*Y  X(1,2,2)*Y  X(1,3,2)*Y  X(1,4,2)*Y ;  ...
%                    X(2,1,2)*Y  X(2,2,2)*Y  X(2,3,2)*Y  X(2,4,2)*Y ;  ...
%                    X(3,1,2)*Y  X(3,2,2)*Y  X(3,3,2)*Y  X(3,4,2)*Y ] )
